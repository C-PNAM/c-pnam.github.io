Novel devices mimicking functionality of human neural systems – neuromorphic devices – is our hope to develop new technology allowing computer hardware to become as energy efficient as human brain when it comes to cognitive tasks of associative memory, recognition of visual images, words and features detection. Memristor is the fourth passive element in electric circuits in addition to three conventional ones (resistors, capacitors and inductors). Memristors change their resistance depending on electric pulse history. This allows, in principle, to fabricate artificial brains with artificial neurons linked via artificial synapses having an ability of learn and take actions based on information available.

Our group of researchers is working on modelling, fabrication, optimisation and testing of various neuromorphic memristor devices and artificial-neural networks based on different physical principles and computer architectures, in partnership with world-leading artificial intelligence companies and in collaboration with the Loughborough Departments of Chemistry and Computer Science, The University of Southampton, CNRS, Texas A&M University and other centres of neuromorphic research.
