Quantum coherent structures containing a large number of qubits constitute a new type of an artificial medium: quantum metamaterials. New features of these media, such as the ability to be in a superposition of states with different properties, strongly influence their response to the electromagnetic field and produce qualitatively new effects.

In particular, quantum metamaterials hold the promise of fast and sensitive quantum antennas and image processors with applications to both fundamental physics and medical imaging. The Department now collaborates with a consortium of European institutions on the development of such detectors for the detection of galactic axions, hypothetical particles â€“ candidates for the role of the dark matter.
