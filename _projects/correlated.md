Designing material properties for technological breakthroughs can be only achieved via the complete understanding of the basic mechanisms that govern the collective behaviour of correlated electrons driving different phases (magnetic, superconducting, multiferroic) and desired characteristics (thermodynamic, transport). Quantum matter, either in equilibrium or out-of-equilibrium, organises itself following principles that modern experimental methods can now uncover. Theoretical efforts should lead to the understanding with predictive power and require modern techniques. There have been many challenges for the theory of correlated electrons, but recent developments and new ideas provide a fresh way forward to explain experimental data that had been a mystery for decades.

The main focus of our group is to study the yet uncovered principles of correlated systems and, at the same time, identify new quantum materials and understand experimental results on carefully chosen existing materials. We achieve this, through a unique blend of highly complementary expertise: many-body analytic field-theory approaches and modelling, ab-initio numerical methods, in close collaboration with our experimental groups and international partners. In particular, we study systems that display rich quantum critical behaviour, and/or systematic effects of topological changes— due to tuning of external parameters—of the Fermi surface (FS) in the correlated regime accompanied by singularities in the density of states (van Hove). We investigate the possibilities of new phases with unexpected physical behaviour. The expectation is that apart from a deep understanding of existing experimental puzzles, our studies will also lead to the discovery of new quantum materials that exhibit this physics.
