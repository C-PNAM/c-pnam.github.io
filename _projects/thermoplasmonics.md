I am fascinated by emergent phenomena in magnetic materials, especially those arising from frustrated interactions in nanoscale planar and 3D artificial spin systems, bulk antiferromagnets, and multiferroic oxides. My experiments using different table-top and large-scale facility techniques often involve light to probe as well as to control magnetic properties, in order to understand the materials’ behaviour, and to implement unique functionalities that arise at the intersection of the fields of magnetism, material science, and optics.​

My main current research goal is to implement hybrid magneto-thermoplasmonic devices that combine novel magnetic functionalities with thermoplasmonic nanoparticles, which allow optical control of targeted heating and engineered thermal gradients. Using this approach, I aim to experimentally understand and control a variety of spintronic and nanomagnetic phenomena, such as the no-equilibrium relaxation dynamics of artificial spin systems, as well as the interaction between magnetic textures and magnons driven by thermal gradients.
