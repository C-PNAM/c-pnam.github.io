Designing material properties for technological breakthroughs can be only achieved via the complete understanding of the basic mechanisms that govern the collective behaviour of correlated electrons driving different phases (magnetic, superconducting, multiferroic) and desired characteristics (thermodynamic, transport). Quantum matter, either in equilibrium or out-of-equilibrium, organises itself following principles that modern experimental methods can now uncover. Theoretical efforts should lead to the understanding with predictive power and require modern techniques. There have been many challenges for the theory of correlated electrons, but recent developments and new ideas provide a fresh way forward to explain experimental data that had been a mystery for decades.

The main focus of our group is to study the yet uncovered principles of correlated systems and, at the same time, identify new quantum materials and understand experimental results on carefully chosen existing materials. We achieve this, through a unique blend of highly complementary expertise: many-body analytic field-theory approaches and modelling, ab-initio numerical methods, in close collaboration with our experimental groups and international partners. In particular, we study systems that display rich quantum critical behaviour, and/or systematic effects of topological changes— due to tuning of external parameters—of the Fermi surface (FS) in the correlated regime accompanied by singularities in the density of states (van Hove). We investigate the possibilities of new phases with unexpected physical behaviour. The expectation is that apart from a deep understanding of existing experimental puzzles, our studies will also lead to the discovery of new quantum materials that exhibit this physics.

2. Strongly correlated magnets and spin liquids

Project members: Dr Ioannis Rousochatzakis, Prof. Joseph Betouras

The notion that strongly interacting spins in a solid can evade ordering down to zero temperature by condensing into a correlated spin fluid – the quantum spin liquid (QSL) – has a long history. While initially proposed as parent phases of high-Tc superconductors, QSLs are now established as one of the prime exponents of intrinsic topological orders, states of matter that cannot be described in the conventional Landau paradigm of symmetry breaking orders. QSLs exhibit a range of remarkable quantum phenomena, including long-range entanglement, topological degeneracy, and emergent fermions and gauge fields out of bosonic degrees of freedom. Controlling such properties holds the promise for quantum information advances and computing applications.

After decades of efforts, the search for QSLs in condensed matter systems has seen an unprecedented progress in the last years, with the discovery of a series of strongly correlated magnets that are fertile grounds for QSL physics. Prominent examples include the layered kagome magnets ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 and Cu4(OH)6FBr, the 3D pyrochlore spin ice Dy2Ti2O7, the Kitaev ruthenate α-RuCl3 and iridate H3LiIr2O6, and the most recent triangular rare-earth delafossites (such as NaYbO2), which open a new arena for exploring spin-ice physics in two spatial dimensions.

Work in the department focuses on modeling such materials from microscopic principles, building from insights from experiment and ab initio calculations and using analytical and large-scale computational many-body methods. A major theme that transcends this research is how we can unambiguously detect QSLs in real materials.

3. Unconventional and high-temperature superconductivity

Project members: Prof. Joseph Betouras, Prof. Feo Kusmartsev

The 1980s’ discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides has marked a new era of condensed matter research, culminated in the more recent discovery of iron-based and nearly ferromagnetic superconductors. One of the most crucial goals in this quest has been to understand the “unconventional” mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon -- beyond the electron-phonon mechanism of Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS). Besides its fundamental significance, a reliable control of the onset temperature Tc for superconductivity above room temperature will revolutionise modern technology. It will enable new means of power transmission and storage, currently infeasible electric and electronic devices, and possibly a material base for quantum computers, similar to what a transistor has been to classical computers.

Work in the department focuses on modelling unconventional superconducting materials of current interest, using analytical and computational quantum many-body techniques, along with insights from experiments and ab initio calculations. The department fosters collaborations with research centres around the world, including Oxford, London, Amherst, Toulouse, Dresden and Minneapolis.
