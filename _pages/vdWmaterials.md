Two-dimensional (2D) materials are extremely thin, often only a single atom thick, crystalline layers.  They can be created by reducing a bulk (3D) layered material (for example graphite) to its individual atomic layers (graphene) by repeated exfoliation, for example by using sticky tape!  The properties of layered bulk materials are transformed and can exhibit exciting new physical phenomena when they are reduced to a single layer.  Graphene, the first 2D material to be isolated, is a single layer of carbon atoms with many exciting new properties.  For example: it is one of the strongest materials but very flexible; electrons in graphene behave as if they have no mass and as if they are moving at the speed of light; and it is a better conductor of electricity than copper.  The discovery of graphene’s potential led to the isolation and characterisation of many other 2D materials. Nearly 700 different types of 2D materials are predicted to exist each with very interesting properties for applications and now research in 2D materials graphene has attracted investment and research by many companies and universities around the world.

Here in the Physics department at Loughborough, our research activity on 2D materials is focused on understanding and developing their properties to create the next generation of novel magnetic, thermoelectric and electronic devices. We create new theories and models to understand how quantum physics can be used to control how electrical current flows through and between the layers of stacks of 2D materials. We investigate how interactions between electrons in these stacks can lead to new and exotic behaviour such as superconductivity at high temperatures. We are also fabricating and measuring heterostructures of 2D crystals for spintronic, thermoelectric and spin-caloritronic devices which take advantage of the intrinsic spin of electrons for low power, high frequency, logic and memory applications. We do our work in close collaboration with research groups around the world.
