Welcome to the Centre for the Physics and Nanoengineering of Advanced Materials, a pioneering hub dedicated to advancing the frontiers of fundamental materials physics and technology. Our center focuses on the research and understanding of the fundamental physics of advanced materials and their applications in neuromorphic devices, quantum technologies, high frequency electronics and nuclear medicine.

We are a growing centre of research which currently comprises XX members of staff, with XX Post Doctoral Researchers and XX PhD students.  Over the last XX years we have attracted XX in funding in [topics of research](/research/) such as 2D materials, neuromorphic devices, strongly correlated electron systems and nuclear medicine.
