We have a large variety of facilities which are available for access to outside users.  Please email Kelly Morrison for more information on the systems and our access fees.  

**Nanolithography and thin film deposition system**

Recently installed £2M Strategic Equipment from EPSRC. This multi-chamber system will enable thin film deposition by RF/DC sputtering and e-beam as well as thermal scanning probe lithography [[Nanofrazor](https://heidelberg-instruments.com/product/nanofrazor/] and scanning probe microscopy (STM/AFM) all without exposing the sample to air.

**Ar ion miller and Microwriter maskless photolithography**
Class 100 clean room with maskless photolithography (resolution limit 600 nm), and argon ion milling available in Department. Training is required for use, however we can also provide patterned devices on arrangement.

**Cryogen-free magnetometer**
Variable magnetic field (0-9T) and temperature (300mK – 400 K) for vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), resistivity and thermal transport (thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient*) measurements.
