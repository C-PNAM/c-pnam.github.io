Dr Leo’s Fellowship project, LIONESS (Light-controlled nanomagnetic and spintronic applications via magneto-thermoplasmonics), will implement a hybrid approach for novel devices to enable fast, precise, and reconfigurable optical control of nano to microscale temperature distributions by light for key applications in magnetic data processing.
