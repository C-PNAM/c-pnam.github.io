We are excited to announce the publication of our article in Communications Physics entitled:   "A magnetically-induced Coulomb gap in graphene due to electron-electron interactions".  

Insights into the fundamental properties of grapheneâ€™s Dirac-Weyl fermions have emerged from studies of electron tunnelling transistors in which an atomically thin layer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is sandwiched between two layers of high purity graphene. Previously we found that when a single defect is present within the hBN tunnel barrier,  we are able to determine accurately the properties of the defect by measuring the tunnel current of electrons through the barrier and the resulting steps in current, see Fig.  Moreover its sharply defined energy level acts as a high resolution spectroscopic probe of the band structure of graphene.  These types of devices have application in metrology as single electron pumps or as elements in devices for quantum technologies.

In this article, we show that when a single defect is present within the hBN tunnel barrier, it can inject electrons into the graphene layers and its sharply defined energy level acts as a high resolution spectroscopic probe of electron-electron interactions in graphene. We report a magnetic field dependent suppression of the tunnel current flowing through a single defect below temperatures of ~2 K. This is attributed to the formation of a magnetically-induced Coulomb gap in the spectral density of electrons tunnelling into graphene due to electron-electron interactions. Our work opens new ways to probe correlated states in 2D devices.
