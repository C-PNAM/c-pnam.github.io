The discovery of the remarkable electronic properties of graphene has had a major impact on condensed matter physics and semiconductor device technology (1-3]. Furthermore, graphene's unique band structure, in which the free electrons behave as massless, relativistic Dirac-Weyl fermions in two dimensions, has interesting implications in other branches of physics. For example, graphene can be regarded as abridge between condensed matter physics and quantum field theory, providing insights into quantum electrodynamics and Klein tunnelling [4,5]. Gravity-like phenomena and curved space-times in graphene and electromagnetic black holes based on graphene have also been considered [6-9].

Here we compare the physical properties of black holes and the electronic properties of graphene when a magnetic field, $B$, is applied perpendicular to the plane of hte graphene layer10-13). We consdier the followingan analogis: 


1. The radius of a black holes' event horizon/and that foasemiclasical electronic
cyclotron orbit in graphenefare proportional to their corresponding mass-energies.

2. The Planck length $l_p=\sqrt{\hbar G/c^3}$ and the quantum magnetic length are both proportional to the square root of Planck's constant, $\hbar$; the entropy of a black hole is given by the number of Planck areas, $l_p^2$, on its event horizon; $l_B^2$ contains one magnetic flux quantum and determines the areal density of electronic states of a Landau level in graphene.

3. The information entropy required to excite a Landau state with large $N$ is analogous to Beckenstein-Hawking
